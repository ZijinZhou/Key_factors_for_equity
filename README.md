# Key_factors_for_equity

I reproduced the models of 'key factors for equity" from the book 'Factor Investing and Asset Allocationï»¿' from CFA Institute. 
The research consists of 4 simple OLS models and about 70 groups of data for each model. 

The research is based on R programming for all the data manipulation and data analysis.

## Research question
What is the role of sectors, and what is the role of regions, in this risk decomposition?     
Which matters more in the return of the equity market?
